Drag the grip behind the laser to move it. Drag the laser aid line to rotate it.</li> <li>Once you are ready click <em>Start Lasers</em>. Lasers will be shot in sequence as indicated by their numbers. The lasers will destroy or re-color the blocks they are aiming at. Blocks up in the air will then fall down. After all lasers shot, the resulting block arrangement will be compared with the goal.</li><li>If a laser has a color different than black then its shot will not destroy but re-color the blocks hit.</li></ul><p>You will win the level if all resulting blocks match with the target blocks.
