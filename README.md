# Feature Ideas

- one of movement/rotation of laser fixed
- movement is restricted to a certain range of angles
- mirrors
- blocks blocking laser shot
- blocks changing color of outgoing laser shot
- linked blocks (falling together)
- colored lasers coloring blocks
- play/pause/go back(?) in laser simulation

# Quality of Life
- editor: directly test level
- rotation handle: use helpline as handle
- handles: add arrows
- select level in game
- visualization of matching blocks once lasers finished
- moving laser: eleminate the jump when cursor is not near actual position of laser
